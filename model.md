# INSTA AI - reCAPTCHA Classification Model

Welcome to the INSTA AI reCAPTCHA Screenshot Classification Model, a core component of the INSTA AI project. INSTA AI is the first AI ghost that automates Twitter (X) logins like a human, bypassing security measures and solving reCAPTCHAs silently. This repository contains a TensorFlow.js-based convolutional neural network (CNN) designed to classify Twitter reCAPTCHA seating arrangement screenshots as "correct" or "incorrect," ensuring INSTA AI's automation can validate successful solutions to challenges like "move the person to the indicated seat."

## Project Overview

This model is tailored for INSTA AI's mission to mimic human behavior on Twitter, specifically targeting reCAPTCHA challenges that require seating a doll in a position matching a reference icon and letter (e.g., "The Doll must seat in the same row and column equivalent to the icon and letter"). The CNN processes images (128x128 pixels) from `data/correct` and `data/incorrect` directories, trains a binary classifier, and can be deployed as an HTTPS Express server to classify screenshots in real-time.

### Features

- **reCAPTCHA Classification**: Classifies Twitter reCAPTCHA seating screenshots as "correct" (doll in correct seat) or "incorrect" (doll in wrong seat).
- **Dual Mode**:
  - **Local Training**: Train the model on a dataset of labeled screenshots.
  - **HTTPS Server**: Deploy as an Express server to classify single or multiple images via API.
- **TensorFlow.js**: Leverages TensorFlow.js for training and inference in a Node.js environment.
- **API Output**: Returns results in the format:
  ```json
  {
    "score": "0.9123",
    "classification": "CORRECT"
  }
  ```
- **Open Source**: Licensed under MIT for community contributions.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 14.x or higher.
- **npm**: Package manager for installing dependencies.
- **Dataset**: Screenshots organized in `data/correct` (correctly solved reCAPTCHAs) and `data/incorrect` (incorrectly solved reCAPTCHAs) directories.
- **Dependencies**:
  - `@tensorflow/tfjs`: For machine learning.
  - `canvas`: For image processing.
  - `express`: For HTTP server.
  - `multer`: For handling image uploads.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iastrebd-cyber/recaptcha-classifier.git
   cd recaptcha-classifier
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Prepare the Dataset** (for training):
   - Place screenshots in `data/correct/` for correctly solved reCAPTCHAs (doll in the correct seat).
   - Place screenshots in `data/incorrect/` for incorrectly solved reCAPTCHAs (doll in the wrong seat).
   - Supported formats: PNG, JPEG.

4. **Verify Directory Structure**:
   ```
   recaptcha-classifier/
   ├── data/
   │   ├── correct/
   │   └── incorrect/
   ├── model/
   │   ├── model.json
   │   └── weights.bin
   ├── uploads/ (created automatically for server mode)
   ├── index.js
   ├── package.json
   ├── README.md
   └── LICENSE
   ```

## Usage

### Local Training Mode

Run the script to train and evaluate the model locally:

```bash
node index.js
```

- The model trains for 20 epochs, using a batch size of 4 and a 20% validation split.
- Training progress is logged, including loss and accuracy metrics.
- The trained model is saved to `./model/model.json` and `./model/weights.bin`.
- Evaluation results are logged, showing classification scores for each screenshot.

#### Example Output

```
📂 Loading images from ./data/correct...
✅ Loaded ./data/correct/screenshot1.png
...
📊 Total samples: 100
✅ Dataset tensors prepared.
⚙️ Creating model...
✅ Model ready.
🚀 Starting training...
📈 Epoch 1: loss=0.6923, acc=0.5125, val_acc=0.5000
...
🧠 Evaluating model on training samples:
📷 screenshot1.png: score=0.9123 → expected=CORRECT → predicted=CORRECT ✅
...
✅ Model saved to ./model
🧹 Cleaned up tensors.
```

### Server Mode

Deploy the model as an HTTPS Express server to classify reCAPTCHA screenshots via API:

1. Ensure the model is trained and saved in the `model/` directory.
2. Start the server:
   ```bash
   node index.js server
   ```
3. The server will run on `http://localhost:3000` (or a custom port if set via the `PORT` environment variable).

#### API Endpoint: `/classify`

- **Method**: POST
- **Content-Type**: `multipart/form-data`
- **Field**: `images` (accepts one or more image files)
- **Response**:
  - Single image: Returns a single result object.
  - Multiple images: Returns an array of result objects with filenames.

#### Example Request (Using `curl`)

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/classify \
  -F "images=@screenshot1.png" \
  -F "images=@screenshot2.png"
```

#### Example Response (Multiple Images)

```json
[
  {
    "filename": "screenshot1.png",
    "score": "0.9123",
    "classification": "CORRECT"
  },
  {
    "filename": "screenshot2.png",
    "score": "0.3421",
    "classification": "INCORRECT"
  }
]
```

#### Example Response (Single Image)

```json
{
  "filename": "screenshot1.png",
  "score": "0.9123",
  "classification": "CORRECT"
}
```

## Integration with INSTA AI

This model is designed to integrate with INSTA AI's reCAPTCHA-solving pipeline:

- **Input**: Screenshots of Twitter reCAPTCHA seating challenges.
- **Output**: Binary classification ("CORRECT" or "INCORRECT") with a confidence score.
- **Deployment**: Use the server mode to provide real-time classification via the `/classify` endpoint, integrating with INSTA AI's automation system.
